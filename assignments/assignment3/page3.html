        <h3> Clam Chowder </h3>
        <p class="one"> What I love about Clam Chowder is that it's official name is New England Clam Chowder which was introduced by the British settlers 
            in the 18th century. New England is located in the northeastern region of the United States. It consists of the states Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. 
            Clam Chowder originated in the state of Massachusetts. Clam chowder is a soup that is now commonly served in all kinds of restaurants.
            This soup is usually served with saltine crackers or a side of oyster crackers. I remember when clam chowder just used to be more of a seafood restaurant kind of dish, 
            but now there are so many places in America where this dish is a common appetizer.
