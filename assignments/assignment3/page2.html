        <h3> THE Hamburger </h3>
        <p class="one"> <em>THE</em> hamburger, also known as just a "burger" is a sandwhich full of grounded mear which is usually beef.
            The meat is usually fried or grilled and is topped with vegetables, cheese and/or condiments. It has been debated whether
            the origin of the hambuger is from Germany or America. Either way, it's a very American food and one of the most consumed.
            Typically, this American burger is served with french fries or chips. Hamburgers/Burgers have become the main item of most
            fast food chains, besides Chick-fil-A of course. The term Hamburger usually implies a "beef burger", but over the years, many different 
            forms of burgers have come into play. These would be burgers like a turkey burger, a bison burger and veggie burgers.
